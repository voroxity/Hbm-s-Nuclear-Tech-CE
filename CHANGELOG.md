> Actually should be at least 2.0.0.0 due to major change in fluid id

### SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES
**Changed the order of fluid ids. NO ATTEMPTS ARE MADE TO AVOID FLUID ID SHIFTING ON NTM ITEMS/TANKS/MACHINES.  
To mitigate, move your fluids into a ForgeFluid fluid tank(e.g. Mekanism tanks) before updating!**
