> Previous public release: 1.5.2.1

> Actually should be at least 2.0.0.0 due to major change in fluid id

### SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES
**Changed the order of fluid ids. A remapper is added to remap FluidTankNTM(affect most machines) and fluid ducts' type,
but ALL ITEMS, including tanks/barrels, will observe an ID shift! to mitigate, move your fluids into a fluid 
tank(machine), or into a ForgerFluid fluid tank(e.g. Mekanism tanks) before updating!**
